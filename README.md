Projects:
1) Predictive Analytics - (Capstone 1 above)
• EDA performed to analyze machine sensor logs for telemetry, errors, maintenance, failures, machine datasets, final data set contained over a million records.
• Machine learning (Ada Boost, RandomForest, GradientBoost, Bagging, DecisionTree, SGD, LogisticRegression) models built for predicting machine failures in the future lag month.
• Used Bootstrapping to optimize for feature engineering. Adaboost gave comparable results when training with accuracy/precision and recall with a given threshold set by business rule.
• Achieved 98% recall

2) NLP Topic Modeling - (Capstone 2 above)
• EDA performed to scrub and clean text. Prepared Data Visualization to gauge categories and distribution of data.
• Latent Semantic analysis model, TF-IDF, Word2Vec for feature selection.
• Increase user engagement by 10%

3) Spark
